 The main objective is to design, implement, and test a simplified yet functional real-time ATC system.
 The system will employ primary and secondary surveillance radars, an operator console for sending commands, a communication system for transmitting commands,
 and a computer system for computations and alerts.
The implementation will utilize periodic tasks, with each aircraft represented as a thread or process, and leverage the QNX RTOS.
